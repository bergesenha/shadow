# SHADOW

## Warning
Shadow reflection library is in early development. The API is probably going to
change and the library is not feature complete.


## Use

### Registering Types, Member Variables, Member Funcions, and Free Functions

Before you can use any of your own types, members, or functions through the
reflection system all the relevant information must be registered. This is done
using macros at namespace scope, typically in your own namespace within the
global namespace scope.

Before registering anything else you need to register all the custom types that
you intend to have access to through the reflection system. This is done with
the REGISTER_TYPE(type_name) successively for all your types enclosed with
REGISTER_TYPE_BEGIN() and REGISTER_TYPE_END(). You can register types in
arbitrary order, even if a type requires a declaration of another type.

```c++
namespace my_space
{

REGISTER_TYPE_BEGIN()


REGISTER_TYPE(foo_type)
REGISTER_TYPE(bar_type)

REGISTER_TYPE(baz_type)

REGISTER_TYPE_END()

}
```

Registering of fundamental types is already handled and are registered within
the REGISTER_TYPE_END macro, so there is no need to register ints, longs or
doubles etc...
